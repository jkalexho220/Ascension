							Ten years ago, a mysterious tower rose up from the ground in the middle of an uninhabited forest. It reached beyond the clouds to a height no mortal could see. And within this tower were artifacts of ancient power and unimaginable riches. 
						</p>
						<p>
							You are one of many adventurers who have entered the tower seeking power, glory, wealth, or perhaps the thrill of the unknown. No one knows what's at the top of the tower, but there isn't a single person here who isn't aiming for the very top.
						</p>
						<p>
							What awaits you upon this perilous journey?

							There are sixteen classes to choose from, each with their own unique and powerful strengths. Each one can be further customized with the power of relics, which provide a variety of stat boosts and unique passives to elevate your gameplay.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is not a slow-paced game where you right click everywhere and your numbers get bigger. Unique enemies with custom combat mechanics will attack you at every turn, and mighty bosses with powerful attacks await you at every floor of the tower. You will need to utilize your character's abilities in creative ways to turn the tide of battle in your favor.
						</p>
						<p>
							Of the sixteen classes, eight of them are showcased below. The rest, you will discover as you play.
